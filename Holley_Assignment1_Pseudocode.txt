initialize int[] scoresArray with 100000 empty indexes
initialize ints winCount, lossCount, die1, die2, roundTotal, firstRoll

FOR LOOP runs until the end of scoresArray is reached:
	
	Set diceOne and diceTwo to random numbers between 1 and 6
	
	IF i == 0 (is this the first roll):
		
		firstRoll = die1 + die2
		
		IF firstRoll is 7 or 11:
		
			
		
	ELSE:
		
		
		
		
Questions
